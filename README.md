# Vehicle Detection and Counting System

This project implements a classical computer vision pipeline to detect and count vehicles in static images using OpenCV in C++. The pipeline avoids the use of machine learning or deep learning models and instead relies on background subtraction, morphological filtering, contour analysis, and geometric heuristics.

## Features

- Classical vehicle detection using:
  - Grayscale conversion
  - Background subtraction (MOG2)
  - Shadow removal
  - Morphological filtering
  - Contour analysis with geometric filtering (area, aspect ratio, solidity, etc.)
- Bounding box generation for each detected vehicle
- Exported results per image (`.txt`)
- Debug output for every processing stage (`gray`, `mask`, `morph`)
- Ready for evaluation against Pascal VOC-formatted ground truth

## 🛠️ Build Instructions

This project uses CMake and requires OpenCV installed on your system.

```bash
# Create build directory
mkdir build && cd build

# Configure project
cmake ..

# Build the project
make

# Run the executable
./vehicle_counter
```

---

## Input & Output

- Input images: `data/images/*.jpg`
- Ground truth (optional): `data/ground_truth/*.xml`
- Output:
  - Annotated images → `output/images/`
  - Detection results (text) → `output/results/`
  - Debug stages → `debug_output/`

---

## Evaluation (Planned/Next Phase)

The next phase involves building an evaluation module that will:
- Parse Pascal VOC `.xml` files as ground truth
- Match predicted boxes using Intersection over Union (IoU ≥ 0.5)
- Compute metrics:
  - Precision, Recall, F1-Score
  - Absolute and Relative Count Errors

---

## Dependencies

- C++17
- OpenCV (tested on OpenCV 4.x)
- CMake (version ≥ 3.10)

---

## Notes

- No machine learning or deep learning techniques are used
- Vehicle classification (car vs. truck vs. bus) is not currently implemented
- Shadow and noise suppression heuristics may require tuning depending on dataset
